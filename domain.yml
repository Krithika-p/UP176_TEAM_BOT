               The number of detectors combined per signal/channel affects the maximum slice thickness.  
               1, 2, 4, 8 or 16* slices can be generated per rotation.

There are 10 blending levels available which are simply the amount of noise reduction based on the maximum of the 100% image reconstructed with the original image data.

Sessions: DMPR sessions are limited to 2,000 images. A DMPR Auto Apps session can be programmed for each of the 10 PMR1s. A DMPR session can be a single group or combined groups.

If a scan stops before all DMPR images for a session are acquired, it may not be possible to activate the interactive mode because all the images are not yet available. Quit the DMPR session to return to Exam Rx display and generate any reformatted images you want in Reformat from ImageWorks desktop. 

When multiple sessions of MPR are stacked, you cannot get to the next one until you finish the previous session. Click Start Direct MPR Review to get to the Interactive display screen and select Quit. If you do not want to quit the current DMPR session, you can still see the reconstructed axial images. Click Auto Link and view the images in the viewport.

Protocols: Reformat protocols used in DMPR must be built in Reformat or Volume Viewer in the General category as Single Step protocols. Multiple Step protocols are excluded from the list of available protocols for selection in DMPR. 

For AutoBatch, the reformat protocol cannot use the Oblique viewport. 

If you prescribed auto batch protocols and then quit DMPR before the auto edge detection starts, the reformatted images are not completed

Please refer the manual for all consideration
