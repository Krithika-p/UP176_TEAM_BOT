              description: A shorter scan geometry allows for a 20% mAs reduction from HSA CT/i single slice axial scan techniques. Gantry aperture is 65 cm. The distance from focal spot to isocentric is54 cm. The distance from focal spotto the detector is 95 cm
            - title: MatrixDetector

              description: Changes in the DAS, Slip Ring and Scan/Recon Unit have been made. There are also new reconstruction algorithms for the multi-slice data.
            - title: Coverage
              description: The Axial Detector Coverage/Beam Collimation for Revolution ACTs system are 1.25, 5, and 10 mm beam collimation/detector coverage. 
            - title: Axial detector signal collection
              description: 2, 4, 8, 16* signals/channels are collected per gantry rotation. Each of 2 to 16 signals are collected from an individual detector or combination of detectors. 
               The number of detectors combined per signal/channel affects the maximum slice thickness.  
               1, 2, 4, 8 or 16* slices can be generated per rotation. 
               The slice thickness can be changed retrospectively. 
               The beam collimation/detector configuration at the time of acquisition affects the retrospective choices.  
               Multi-slice axial imaging is faster than a single slice helical scanner using a 1:1 pitch.
            - title: Axial interval
              description: The interval is equal to the number of images per rotation multiplied by the beam collimation. For example, in 4 x 1.25 mode, 4 images are generated, with each layer 1.25mm thick, for a total coverage range of 5 mm per rotation.
            - title: Helical pitch, scan mode, and collimation
              description: Scan modes for helical are expressed in terms of pitch. Helical pitch is defined as the ratio of table travel per rotation in millimeters divided by the beam collimation.
