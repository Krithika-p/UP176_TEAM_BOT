Every 7 days a beam quality check will be run to check the integrity of the x-ray beam. You will be prompted to make sure the beam is clear. This will increase tube Warm up time slightly.  
GE recommends that you warm up the tube after two hours of non-use. Only the tube warm-up scans need to be done at this time.
If the detectors are cold due to the A1 Power Panel (Breaker) being off, turn the system on and wait two hours before performing a tube warm up. This allows the detectors to return to their operating temperature.

Reconstruction ASiR images involves defining the level of noise reduction desired for the parameters used for various applications. Image reconstruction is a blending of the original images and a percentage of an image with 100% noise reduction. There are 10 blending levels available which are simply the amount of noise reduction based on the maximum of the 100% image reconstructed with the original image data. It is expected that confidently selecting the optimal amount of noise reduction and integrating the reduction in dose possible will require some adaptation on how this reconstruction technique works.

The software dose not make the noise level changes or mA adjustment automatically when ASiR is enabled. These changes need to be calculated using the following tables to make changes to noise index or manual mA values. 
Refer to Noise based and Manual mA for guidance in making parameter step adjustments during ASiR evaluation process.

Before using ASiR, the site physicist, in collaboration with the Radiologist, should conduct image quality evaluations with varying degrees of ASiR and different scan techniques, both at routine dose and with decreased dose. This should be done using your site's preferred method and phantoms. Using this information, an appropriate starting point for ASiR level and diagnostic scanning techniques can be incorporated into your site's protocols. 

WhenASiR is used for dose reduction or image quality improvement,parameter settings should be made in steps and then reviewed for diagnostic image quality until the desired clinically appropriate image quality is achieved.
